###Problem Statement
Games in general have been a popular past time, and there's been
many different type of ways to keep track of game collections. Each 
platform have their own respective library but that is only for that specific
platform. Also with the digital download being a more popular way to get games
it is even harder to know what a person has without logging in multiple
accounts to figure it out. 

The range of games is quite expansive, so it will be great to have
all the information in one place instead of looking in multiple different locations.
